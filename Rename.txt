Renaming Git Branch
Follow the steps below to rename a Local and Remote Git Branch:

1 - Start by switching to the local branch which you want to rename:
  - git checkout <old_name>

2 - Rename the local branch by typing:
  - git branch -m <new_name>

3 - If youâ€™ve already pushed the <old_name> branch to the remote repository delete the <old_name> remote branch:
  - git push origin --delete <old_name>

4 - Finally, push the <new_name> local branch and reset the upstream branch:
  - git push origin -u <new_name>
